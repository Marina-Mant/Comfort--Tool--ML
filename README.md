# Comfort Tool - ML

This was my project during my summer internship as a Data Science Trainee on an IT company.

This repository includes:
1) a configuarion file (where the inventories of both the regressors and input variables per target are included)
2) a gitignore file, for our convienience
3) a CSV summary of the best performing models per target, with their respective metrics
4) an environment.yml file
5) a requirements.txt file (includes the python libraries versions to ensure the efficiency of the python scripts)
6) CSV file for the feature importances per target and model
7) Three python scripts:
                         (1) for training and evaluating the models,
                         (2) for predicting the values of our target features based on the architecture of the CSV the first script was written on,
                         (3) for the creation of an interactive dashboard with three tabs (to make it user friendly), written using the streamlit library
